# Database Adminer

Adminer for Postgres/MYSQL/SQL Web Administrative tool from https://www.adminer.org

> **PS: Never trust a strangers code in your production services, especially for something as critical as your database, for safety clone this repository and track the original [adminer](https://github.com/vrana/adminer) branch if you want to execute this build in production, at best you should never permanently authorize a UI tool to be able to access databases running in production**
